# Getting Started

For a long time, Redux had been the leader library of global state management in React. But with the introduction of hooks, I have found that libraries like react-query or useSWR() handle the fetching of data with less boilerplate.

But the simple UI state like side-menu expand, theme, dark-mode, etc. require separate management â€” in which case a simple global state management library like Jotai (https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) becomes handy.

git clone https://github.com/princeofv/jotai-example

cd jotai-example

npm install
